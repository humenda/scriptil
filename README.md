### Contributing

Scripts are grouped by their category. Please select a category first. If your
category is not present, create one in your pull request (PR). In general,
handing in a PR is the best way to add or update repository contents. The
following steps are required:

1.  Add a stanza to the beginning of the script that explains very brief the
    purpose and add information about the year of writing, the author and the
    licence. Only FLOSS licences are allowed.
2.  Add a directory for your script in the respective category with a README.md
    that explains dependencies and usage.
3.  Link the README from this file.
4.  Commit with a meaningful message: a short line mentioning your change and a
    longer paragraph below giving details. Please use the `git log` as an
    example.
5.  The command-line will never be the same for us! :-)

You can have a look at the existing scripts if in doubt.
